To initialize the database, please first run
(1) "Phase_3/app/insert_data.py", which defines the database/schema and reads
          data from "Phase_3/data" into those tables
(2) "Phase_3/app/cal_dist.sql", a user defined function to calculate distance
          between any pair of zip codes

All table creation, data insertion, table modification and data extraction
    queries are included in corresponding functions in "Phase_3/app/queries.py"


Please IGNORE the folder called "Phase_3/sqlfiles" as those files were only used
    to quickly perform exercises to ensure the correctness of sql output
